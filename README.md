# Animal-Pictures-Classification-using-CNN
CNN to classify animal pictures from the Animal-10 dataset

## Topic

This project is about testing a CNN on the Animal-10 dataset, which contains 28K medium quality image of ten animals : squirrel, hen, horse, butterfly, dog, cat, cow, spider, sheep
and elephant. The pictures have been all downloaded from google so they have different sizes. I will test a multilayered CNN to try and categorize the pictures, after having processed
the images and done the essential transformations. And after the training phase I will go on to test my model of a test set it has never seen before. I'm hoping for an accuracy of about 80%.

## Objectives 

- Preprocess the data to make it machine learning ready
- Build a CNN with enough layers to identify the differences between the images
- Train and test the model and get the accuracy
